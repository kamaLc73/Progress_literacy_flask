Progress literacy is a web application built using Flask and SQLite, 
designed to facilitate literacy programs by allowing users to register, 
log in, take quizzes, and track their progress. The platform supports user roles, 
enabling regular users to participate in quizzes and view results,
while administrators can manage quiz content, monitor user progress, and generate statistical reports. 
With a focus on user experience, Suivi Alpha provides a dynamic and secure environment for improving literacy skills.
